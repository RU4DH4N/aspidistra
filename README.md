# What is Aspidistra?

Aspidistra is a way for me to sync files from my laptop to my computer after a lecture, without having to open my laptop and type a command or such.

## Why not use [rsync](https://github.com/RsyncProject/rsync) or [insert tool here]?

Because that wouldn't be fun, now, would it?

## How it'll work?

I have no clue.

but here's the basic idea I have

WIFI changed -> check if home wifi -> if home wifi check for server -> if server exists confirm it's actually my server -> if server is mine -> send diff to the server
